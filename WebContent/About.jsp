The New School. which was established in January 2017, is run by the Society of St. Patrick, whose educational institutions in India and abroad are highly
 appreciated for the sound, moral, intellectual and physical education imparted
  to the children committed to their care. The Brothers consider the formation 
  of character the first essential of any sound educational system, and 
  so great stress is laid on the inculcation of high ideals, good behaviour
   and moral rectitude. The curriculum is designed to stimulate intellectual 
   growth and talent, based on universal values of love, compassion and shared
    responsibility. Innovative methodologies encourage independent expression and progressive outlook.</p>

<p>The school attaches great importance to a varied programme of activities outside
 the ordinary class routine. These are designed to develop important traits like 
 honesty, self-confidence, creativity, teamwork and diligence, and to hone latent
  talents of leadership and responsibility. The proper use of library facilities, 
  study circles and clubs, debates, elocution and quiz contests, dramatics, music
   and dance  Western and Indian and excursions are some of the cultural as well as
    educational activities that are encouraged in the school.</p>

<p>Religious instruction is imparted to Christian students and they attend mass on 
special occasions and on the first Friday of every month. All students are given a 
comprehensive course in Value Education, Environmental Studies and Faith Formation.
 In teaching the Humanities and the Sciences, the aim is to impart an integrated 
 theoretical and practical knowledge based on the latest techniques and the requirements of the syllabus of the CBSE.</p>

and a healthy spirit of competition.</p>

<p>The school has extensive playing fields, a Science Park and a Brain Gym.
